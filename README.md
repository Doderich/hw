## :computer:Tech

FHW uses the following of resources to work properly:
- Properly installed - [Flutter SDK] 
- [VS Code] - or a other Texteditor/IDE such as Android Studio
- [FireBase] - FHW requires a Firebase Database connection
- Flutter plugins listed in the pubspec.yaml file

And of course FWH itself is open source with a [public repository] by [me]
 on GitHub.

## :card_index_dividers:Installation

FHW requires:
- flutter 3.+ properly installed
- firebase-tools 11.+

You need to create your own firebase_option.dart by following this [Firebase Connection Guide] from Google.
